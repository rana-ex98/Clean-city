# Clean-city
## Problem Statement: Conceptualise and design a software solution to make a city clean and garbage free.

When it comes to a solution for smart city the first thought is making dustbins smart or we can say making them talk. Smart bins, or solar-powered trash compactor are already in use across the globe, from Brooklyn, New York to England and Queensland in Australia. These bins use smart sensors to know when to begin compacting the rubbish and to alert the collectors when they're full â€“ making the serving of the garbage collection much more efficient.

The idea is to make an application where these sensors can be connected to the users mobile so that they can manage their garbage with the help of technology.

This same application can be utilized by the authorities managing garbage so as to ease the process.
